# ðŸš˜Tesla-s-Recall-Dilemma-A-Data-Driven-Exploration-of-OTA-Innovation-Risk-and-Reliability
A data-driven analysis of Teslaâ€™s vehicle recalls from 2015â€“2024, highlighting root causes, Over-the-Air (OTA) updates, industry benchmarking, financial implications, and strategic recommendations to enhance vehicle reliability and customer trust.

## About the Project

This capstone project provides a comprehensive analysis of Teslaâ€™s vehicle recall landscape between 2015 and 2024. It investigates the root causes of recalls, evaluates the role of Over-the-Air (OTA) software updates, benchmarks Tesla against major automakers, and offers strategic recommendations to strengthen quality assurance in the electric vehicle (EV) industry.

## Key Highlights

- **5.1 Million Vehicles Recalled** in 2024 alone, with a 2,450% increase since 2015.
- **OTA Updates vs. Physical Repairs:** 37% of Tesla recalls were resolved digitally, but 63% still required physical intervention.
- **Root Causes:**
  - 44% Mixed Software-Hardware Failures
  - 34% Hardware-Only Failures
  - 11% Pure Software Bugs
- **Component Vulnerabilities:**
  - Electrical Systems
  - ADAS (Autopilot Components)
  - Airbags and Safety Systems
- **Financial Impact:** Estimated $2.2B in total recall-related costs; OTA updates offered a 97% cost reduction compared to physical repairs.
- **Strategic Recommendations:**
  - Strengthen software testing protocols
  - Implement AI-driven predictive maintenance
  - Enhance hardware-software fault isolation
  - Improve customer-facing recall communications
  - Deepen collaboration with regulators
